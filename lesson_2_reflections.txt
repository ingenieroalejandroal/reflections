1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Answer: It converts the current directory into a repository. It also creates a new .git file in it. 
	
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Answer: The Staging area is a place where you can put the files that you want to commit to the repository. 
			It may contain several files or just one, and is very helpfull because you are able to commit all changes
			with just one commit.
