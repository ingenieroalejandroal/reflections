1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Answer: When I want to share my project in GitHub and start working with other people making changes to the same project.
  
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Answer: Because may be I don't want to update always all changes to my local. Also if the files are updated automatically 
	It will cause to get very frequent files in conflict. 

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

		forks: This is to clone a repository to your account directly in GitHub
		clones: It's used to clone a repository from GitHub to you're local. Or from local to local
		branches: Used locally to create a new version (branch) of your code/project
		
4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Answer: The benefit is that first, you don't override your local changes with a remote version.
	You are able to merge the remote branch (origin/master) with your local branch (master) and 
	check al solve conflicts manually. 
	
5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Answer: The hardest thing would be to resolve conflicts on files. Also work without Git or GitHub
	would make harder to track the history if changes. Actually I don't see any advantage working without
	Git or GitHub.
