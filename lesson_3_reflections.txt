1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Answer: When I want to share my project in GitHub and start working with other people making changes to the same project.
  
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Answer: Because may be I don't want to update always all changes to my local. Also if the files are updated automatically 
	It will cause to get very frequent files in conflict.
